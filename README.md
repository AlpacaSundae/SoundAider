# SoundAider

You know how Windows 11 now makes it pretty easy to quickly change your desired output device with the taskbar sound icon? Well you also know how it DOESN'T make it easy to get it to also change your communications output because your use case has no reason for separating the two, even though it is a nice thought for certain days you may want this feature but in general you don't and you wish there was no segregation between the two? Well come on down and taste SoundAider, here we have OPTIONS. If you want the communication device for either input or output devices to also get changed to your default device selection YOU CAN HAVE IT DO THAT.

## Features

display current default devices
set default devices
sync input/output default communications device with default device
